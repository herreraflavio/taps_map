  <h1>Parking Pay Stations</h1>
  <p>
    The campus parking pay stations are electronic machines used to manage the
    payment of parking fees in designated parking areas. They typically offer
    two types of permits: hourly and daily. These permits allow drivers to park
    their vehicles in designated areas. Payments can be made with card and
    mobile app. For more information please contact TAPS at (209) 822-8277 or
